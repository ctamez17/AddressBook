### Build an Address Book with Fetch API
# Overview
    If you worked on the practice problem from last night you should have a firm grasp of an API and how to request data from it. 
    Today we're going to build an address book using a free API as our server of data.

# Address Book
    In pairs, create a list of Users and Display Their Info

# Instructions
    01. Read these instructions and understand the requirements FIRST.
    02. Whiteboard your app
    03. Make a code plan
    04. Psuedo code and then translate to Javascript
    05. Create a new repo (name it descriptively well) and clone it to your local machine and share it with your partner
    06. Open the directory and create an index.html and main.js file to fetch a user and display them one at at time.
    07. Use the api: https://randomuser.me/api/ to fetch a user now.
    08. Fetch a new user multiple times and store them in an array.
    09. Then list out all the users in your address book array by name and picture.
    10. Figure out how to fetch multiple users in one fetch requests
    11. Fetch multiple users on window load.
    12. Add a button to each user that when clicked displays the rest of their information like DOB, address and so forth.
    13. Once you have the functionality working, feel free to style and structure your address book with CSS and HTML
    14. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL OF THIS BY NOW. TRUST YOURSELF!!
